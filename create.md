### Films & Creative Work

Nights I slept well when I made these works:

- **[42 - a short film made on Runway](https://youtu.be/_baZAf1MIjs)** - "If you can ask one question to God or the all-knowing entity, what will it be?" created using Runway, and Eleven Labs. First film of mine made without camera. 
- **[Adu Ni Cha - Ginger Tea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l87Y35H2XRE)**  (>200k views) - Love doesn't follow family rules or cultural mapsâ€”it writes its own story.
- **Dance videos** - Shot my talented friends performing Indian classical dances like [Bharatnatyam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHui4yIOACI) and [semi-classical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSQmnPxrkK4).
- **[Kalki News](https://youtu.be/8T0qC74lA9I)** - Wrote, directed and acted in a series of John Oliver style show for Indian audience.
