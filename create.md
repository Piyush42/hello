### Films & Creative Work

Nights I slept well when I made these works:

- **[AI-native film](https://youtu.be/_baZAf1MIjs)** - "If you can ask one question to God or the all-knowing entity, what will it be?" created using Runway, and Eleven Labs. 
- **[Adu Ni Cha - Ginger Tea]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l87Y35H2XRE))**  (>200k views) - A short film on the story of navigating love, family, and cultural differences over a cup of chai or more.
- **[Dance videos]** (2016-now) - Indian classical dances like [Bharatnatyam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHui4yIOACI) and [semi-classical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSQmnPxrkK4).
- **[Kalki News](https://youtu.be/8T0qC74lA9I)** - John Oliver style show for Indian audience.
