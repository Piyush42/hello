# Piyush Varanjani

ðŸ‘‹ I am an entrepreneur focused on product and GTM. Recently I was at Stripe focused on GTM in APAC. I have worked at TransferWise (~4 years) and other startups.

In university, I spent more time working on startups than studying. Since then I've been working with startups across Singapore, Silicon Valley, and Europe.

Some founders believed in me and I got to invest in a few of them:
- [Locofy.ai](https://www.locofy.ai/)
- [Defog.ai](https://defog.ai/) (YC W23)

I am currently exploring new ideas and traveling the world.
