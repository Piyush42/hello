ðŸ‘‹ I sleep happy when I create. Previously worked on product, GTM and growth at Stripe, Wise (fka TransferWise) and a few other startups. In university, I spent more time working on startups than studying. Since then I've been scaling startups across Silicon Valley, APAC (via Singapore), Israel, and Europe.

I have won a few 48-hours hackathons internationally in [Canada (Hack The North)](https://www.facebook.com/moesingapore/posts/congratulations-to-piyush-varanjani-a-final-year-information-systems-student-at-/10155302983587004/), [Israel (Startup Pirates)](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/why-chutzpah-could-be-startup-nations-greatest-startup-secret-export/), but probabaly more proud of winning 48 hour film festivals - some work [here](https://piyush42.github.io/hello/create/). 

## Investments
Some founders believed in me and I got to invest in a few of them:
- [Locofy.ai](https://www.locofy.ai/): Turn your designs into production-ready frontend code
- [Defog.ai](https://defog.ai/) (YC W23): AI-powered analytics and insights

## Now
I am in San Francisco and currently exploring and building in AI. Taking my time to work on my life's work so the rest of my career looks like a footnote. 

If you're building something groundbreaking in AI and want to talk on product/GTM, I am at 42piyush [at] gmail dot com.

If I were not into technology, I'd be a struggling moviemaker or a happily frustrated technocrat.

Luckily, I have friends and family who don't care about any of the above stuff.
