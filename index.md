ðŸ‘‹ I am an entrepreneur focused on product and GTM. Recently I was at Stripe focused on GTM in APAC. I have worked at other scaleups like TransferWise (~4 years) and other startups. 

In university, I spent more time working on startups than studying. Since then I've been working with startups and sacled across Singapore, Silicon Valley, and Europe.

I have won some [48-hours](https://www.facebook.com/moesingapore/posts/congratulations-to-piyush-varanjani-a-final-year-information-systems-student-at-/10155302983587004/) hackathons but probabaly more proud of winning 48 hour film festivals.

## Investments
Some founders believed in me and I got to invest in a few of them:
- [Locofy.ai](https://www.locofy.ai/): Turn your designs into production-ready frontend code
- [Defog.ai](https://defog.ai/) (YC W23): AI-powered analytics and insights

I am currently exploring new ideas and traveling the world.

If I were not into technology, I'd be a struggling moviemaker or a happily frustrated technocrat.
