ðŸ‘‹ I am an entrepreneur focused on product and GTM. Recently I was at Stripe focused on GTM in APAC. I have worked at other scaleups like TransferWise (~4 years) and other startups. 

In university, I spent more time working on startups than studying. Since then I've been working with startups and sacled across Singapore, Silicon Valley, and Europe.

## Investments
Some founders believed in me and I got to invest in a few of them:
- [Locofy.ai](https://www.locofy.ai/): Turn your designs into production-ready frontend code
- [Defog.ai](https://defog.ai/) (YC W23): AI-powered analytics and insights

I am currently exploring new ideas and traveling the world.

I am at 42piyush [at] gmail dot com if you're building in AI and want to talk on product/GTM.
