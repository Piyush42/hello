_"What is the Latin word for a place where three roads meet?"_ This was the first trivia question we had in our tipsy-trivia game night we hosted a few years back. The answer to that trivia, and how Maslow would have been a great conversationalist, is explored below.

I love hosting friends at home for trivia or board game nights. If you ever want to test your persuasion (or deception) skills—play [Avalon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/resistance-avalon) with your friends. We did, and we lost many games—and a few friends for a night. When mulling over my losses, I learned that I love playing Avalon with one group of friends, while with others, we enjoy our company more in smaller groups or even one-on-one. 

Why is it that with some friends, you can never hold a long conversation one-on-one, yet enjoy their company in a big group? And why do others shine in a smaller setting but hate being in a big group? I found the answer in my university psychology class notes—Maslow.

As many of you might already be familiar, Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a psychological theory outlining human needs, starting with the most basic physiological needs and moving up to self-actualization. It is represented as a **pyramid with five levels:** physiological needs, safety needs, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization.

### _Now, instead of the hierarchy of needs, what if we see it as the hierarchy of topics of conversation?_

In a big group of eight or more people, the conversation will revolve around food, sex, or—if you're unlucky—the weather. **Basic needs.**  

Cut to a smaller group of three to five, and you can slowly unmask yourself, revealing what ticks you off in your relationships, your unfulfilled ambition of being a YouTuber, or that sense of pride in finally mastering a handstand. **Smaller groups allow for comfortable silences.**  

Finally, you're alone with your close friend—your [tier one](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/10-types-odd-friendships-youre-probably-part.html) friend. When you're alone with them, your insecurities come out. They've seen you puke on yourself outside a club, and they still held your hand. They laugh at your bookmarked Instagram reels that only you two would find funny. They are the WhatsApp chat where you send your grocery list as a reminder for yourself.

Maslow is credited as a brilliant psychologist, but he also gave us the **hierarchy of topics we talk about, depending on the number of people in the conversation and the shared vulnerability.**

### **Why does this matter?**
Because our environment shapes us. Being aware of this lets us actively decide how we want to be shaped.

And every friend has a place. It would be oddly terrifying to have a friend who's always deep, or, on the other hand, a friend who thinks the solution to every problem is in the next drink. **Every friend has a place.**

I often ask myself:  
- Do I have a group of friends who can distract me without asking about my life? ✅  
- And do I also have friends who don't need their phone or alcohol to talk for hours about how they almost got a nose job due to insecurities? ✅  

Luckily, I do. And we often play Avalon, too.
