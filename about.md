# About Me

I'm Piyush Varanjani, an entrepreneur with a focus on product and go-to-market strategy.

## Professional Experience

Most recently, I was at Stripe focusing on GTM in APAC. Before that, I spent about 4 years at TransferWise (now Wise) and worked with several other startups across different markets.

My entrepreneurial journey began in university, where I prioritized startup work over academics. This led me to Israel for my first product management experience, followed by opportunities in Singapore, Silicon Valley, and Europe.

## Beyond Work

Outside of startups, my interests include:
- Public policy
- Adventure sports (recently completed a trek to Everest Base Camp)
- Meditation
- Movies
